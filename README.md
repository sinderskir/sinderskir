### Hey! ðŸ™ƒ

My name is Rafaela Sinderski. I'm a Brazilian data journalist and researcher focused on political conflict, gender-based violence, and press freedom who sees communication as a tool to <b>protect democracy and fight inequalities</b>. I attended the Lede Program 2023 at Columbia University, in NYC, and have been practicing my programming skills ever since.

I am always available to exchange ideas about projects involving political violence, gender, and data. Please reach out to me if you'd like to share your thoughts on these topics (or just want to say hi).
